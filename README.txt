Class Description: 

The class is of a cup. A cup has many factors and qualities that make it the specific cup that it is, and some are 
highlighted here in this class. In a larger program that involves everyday objects, this class could be helpful 
in organizing the specific actions of a cup and would help a programmer to avoid repeating code whenever they
wanted to utilize their code to implement a cup into their script. 



Variable Descriptions:

size - This is the size of the cup. This helps make the volume the cup has be more intuitive as the volume a cup
starts with would correlate with the size of the cup.

volume - The current volume of liquid in the cup at any one time. Measured in mL

name - organizes each instance of the class by giving each object a name that can be accessed in methods of the 
class and printed to organize information about each object

what_is_my_purpose - an overarching message about every cup that they will print whenever displaying their 
information



Method Descriptions:

spill - This method doesn't take any arguments, regardless of the current size or volume of the cup this method
sets the volume of the cup to zero and prints a funny message. Useful for setting the volume of a cup to zero as
well as being a funny gag. Doesn't return anything

display - A very helpful method to call whenever the programmer wants to see all of the pertinent information
about a cup. Does not take arguments. Doesn't return anything



Demo Program Description:

The demo program begins by creating two cup objects and displaying their information when they are created. It
edits the size and volume of the first cup object before using the spill method on the same object. Now that 
the first cup is empty, the second cup donates some of its volume to share with the first cup. The program ends
with the cups displaying their information after all of these exchanges and mishaps. 



Demo Program Instructions:
Run the program in the terminal using 'python3 assignment_10_1.py'
